# edX Dashboard
 
Dashboard visualizing edX course completion rates and relevant statistics from 2012 to 2016. The dashboard can be accessed <a href = "https://public.tableau.com/profile/ahmad.aldhalaan#!/vizhome/edX/Dashboard1?publish=yes">here</a>.

Here we ask, are there specific indicators that appear to be predictors for higher course completion rates for edX online courses?

The courses with the highest completion rates (> 20%) are all short courses from the Humanities, History, Design, Religion and Education subject area. They vary in popularity. However, none of these courses is overly popular, with the most popular course recording 12,856 participants. 17.42% of participants posted in the course forums for these courses, compared to the average for all edX courses (9.09%). 78.85% of participants hold a bachelor's degree (compared to the average for all edX courses - 72.12%) and 45.43% are female (compared to the average for all edX courses - 33.08%). 

These statistics might shed light into the nature of these courses and their participants and assist course administrators in their efforts of increasing student completion rates. Our dashboard seems to indicate that short humanities courses have the highest completion rates and long STEM courses have the lowest completion rates.
